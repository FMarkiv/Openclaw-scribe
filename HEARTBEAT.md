# Heartbeat Tasks

Tasks listed here are executed periodically as background operations.
Each line starting with `- ` is treated as a separate task.
Results are logged to today's daily note (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`).

If a task produces information the user should see, prefix that
part of the response with `NOTIFY:` to route it to the Notifications
section of the daily note.

## Recurring

- Check for any pending items in MEMORY.md that need follow-up
- Review today's daily note for decisions that should be promoted to long-term memory
